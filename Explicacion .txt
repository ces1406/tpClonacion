The typical scenario of daily work on Android app developement with Git Flow looks like this: we create a feature branch, work on it, and, once the branch is merged, we leave it and we go to the next task.  We simply forget or don’t care to remove these development branches from our local repository and we finally find ourselves in a situation with a whole bunch of unnecessary branches in our repo.

We could leave it like that but it is useless to keep a few-month-old branch if it has been merged or is no longer relevant. What’s more, it can impede our work.
